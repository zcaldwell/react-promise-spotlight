# Promise Me‚ùó ü§ûüèæü§ûüèº

## Getting Started

Use [this template](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/spotlight-promise-me) to get started.

### Learning Objectives

- `promises`
- `fetch`
- `.then`, `.catch`, `.finally`
- `async/await`, `try/catch`

### Description

As a software engineer, when you want to build something useful it will have to interact with an API. API's are how we interact with data from other sources. There are various libraries built that aid data fetching, but the built in javascript method is `fetch`. A `fetch` will return a [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

`promises` give us two different types of syntax to interact with our data from our `promise`. Those two different types are:
- [`.then`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then)
- [`async/await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)

These two syntaxes serve identical purposes and can be used interchangebly. Which syntax used is completely dealer's choice. The syntaxes will differ, but they are both handling the `promise` with our data.

We'll practice fetching data from api's using both of these types of syntaxes.

These two tools will perform
